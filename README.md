# Android Bluetooth Client for Arduino (HC-05, HC-06)

## Short description

This application is a bluetooth client used to control an Arduino project.

It provides 32 programmable macro buttons.

This application is originally designed for the Arduino project [MiminuConntroller](https://github.com/Siziksu/MiminuController), a USB MIDI controller for Arduino MEGA 2560.

## What moves this application:

- `Dagger 2` for the dependency injection.
- `Butterknife`for the view bindings.
- `RxJava` for the asynchronous calls.
- `Retrofit` as an http client.  
- `Calligraphy` for the font faces.
